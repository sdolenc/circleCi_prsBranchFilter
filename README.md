# test_prs_with_branch_filter_on_circle_ci
Branch filtering appears to prevent CircleCi from running tests. For example, https://github.com/sdolenc/circle_ci_experiments/pull/4 and https://github.com/sdolenc/circle_ci_experiments/pull/5 says "Waiting for status to be reported"

This is a simple workaround for these types of issues.
